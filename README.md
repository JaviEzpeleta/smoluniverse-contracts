# First goal:

learn how to create an ERC-20 token on Sepolia ETH. I will call it "Smol
Universe Coin" with the ticker "SMOL"

I'll probably use Base's Sepolia testnet.

âœ… done!! Contract deployed to: 0xb8e5d6eDf418479aA4CC73def6E4DbB2a07E47E9

How to deploy:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base_sepolia
```
